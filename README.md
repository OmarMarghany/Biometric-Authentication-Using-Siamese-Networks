# 🖐️ Biometric Authentication Using Siamese Networks

## 📌 Project Overview
This project implements a **biometric authentication system** using a **Siamese Neural Network**.  
The system verifies user identities by comparing palmprint images, leveraging the **twin network method** to learn similarity metrics between pairs of images.  

With this approach, the model achieves **high accuracy and low error rates**, making it suitable for secure biometric verification tasks.
